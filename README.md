## JSON Schema Generator
A CLI tool written in C to generate JSON Schemas based on this specification: http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema#

This is a work-in-progress tool, being built as a hobby in my spare time. It is not intended for production use.

## TODOS
- [X] Write schema generator for all json types
- [ ] Port to wasm and make a cool website with github pages
